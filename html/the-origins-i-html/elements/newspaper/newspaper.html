<p>SCHOOL BOARD SEEKS $55 MILLION</p>
<p><strong>New Hanover commissioners are unlikely to approve a bond vote</strong></p>

<p>Saying they don't want to make hasty decisions, the New Hanover Country Commissioners made it clear Friday that they
    are unlikely to approve holding a school board referendum in May.</p>
<p>And if the school board wants a bond vote at all, it needs to make deep cuts in its $55 million request for school
    buildings, commissioners say.</p>
<p>To adhere to a schedule that would get a referendum before voters in May, the school board and the Country
    Commissioners would have to pass resolutions by Monday. The school board is schedule to meet at 7 a.m. Monday, and
    the commissioners will meet two hours later.</p>
<p>The school board's latest plan would add a fourth high school in the country, rebuild Gregory Elementary School and
    pay for computers and renovations at other schools. But that plan may be revamped before it goes before the County
    Commissioners or the public for approval, school board Chairman Janice Cavenaugh said Friday.</p>
<p>Commissioners' Chairman Bobby Greer said the school board should present a realistic proposal that the commissioners
    can support and the voters will approve. If a referendum fails, Mr. Greet said the school board will look to the
    commissioners for school construction money.</p>
<p>Under the $55 million plan, the highest annual payment on the bonds would be about $6 million, according to the
    county. That's equal to about 8 cents of the current tax rate.</p>
<p>In addition, Cape Fear Community College is proposing a $14 million bond issue to build health and work force
    training builds. The highest annual payment on the community college debt would be about $1.5 million, which would
    increase the tax rate by about 2 cents.</p>
